# Techdegree-Project-2
 My 2nd Techdegree Project

This project arranges a list of student into several pages.

The project uses a function to display a selection of students on each page, and a function to add links to each page, using DOM Manipulation techniques and some event listeners.
The project uses progressive enhancement, meaning that the page would still display all the students in one page with javascript turned off,
and no javascript code has been used in the html file, instead, writing all of it in a separate file.
